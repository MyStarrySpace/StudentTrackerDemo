# Application Initialization

To use this application you should have `node` and `npm` installed and issue the following commands:

1. `npm install`: this will install the required `node` libraries.
2. `npm run watch`: this will compile the application code and produce an `App.js` file in the `static` directory. This command will also continue to run until explicitly killed (e.g., control-C).
3. `npm start`: this will run the Express server, `server.js`, allowing you to view the running application in the browser window.
